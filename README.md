# hungergames

An ecosystem simulater that creates creatures with the ability to make decisions according to their needs. 
Creatures can decide to reproduce, attack, run, follow, or wander, depending on their hunger levels, energy levels, and proximity to other creatures.

I created this as a way to practice OOP as well as the Processing java library.
